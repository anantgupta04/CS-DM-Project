If you want to run PessimisticmajoritySorting with lambda = 0.6 you should comment lines 69 and 73 and uncomment lines 70 and 73.
If you want to run PessimisticmajoritySorting with lambda = 0.7 you should comment lines 69 and 73 and uncomment lines 71 and 74.

If you want to run OptimisticcmajoritySorting with lambda = 0.6 you should comment lines 150 and 153 and uncomment lines 151 and 154.
If you want to run OptimisticcmajoritySorting with lambda = 0.6 you should comment lines 150 and 153 and uncomment lines 152 and 155.
